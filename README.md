# New Game Every Week - official repository

Here you will find the source code of my Android app [New Game Every Week](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monkeybison.newgameeveryday)

If you want to compile and run the game on your PC I suggest downloading [Qt Creator (IDE)](http://www.qt.io/download/).
The whole application was created using:
 - Qt Creator (free version)
 - PhotoFiltre 7 (freeware version)
 - GIMP 2
